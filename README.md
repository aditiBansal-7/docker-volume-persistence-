# 🚀 Docker Volume Persistence: Bind Mounts on Linux Container 🐳  

## 📌 Introduction  
This experiment demonstrates how to use **Docker Bind Mounts** with a **Linux container** to persist data beyond the container’s lifecycle.  
By mounting a local directory into a container, data remains accessible even after the container is removed.  

---

## 🔧 Steps & Observations  

### 🏗 Step 1: Running a Container with a Bind Mount  
Run the following command:  

```sh
docker run -dit --name alpine_with_bind_mount -v C:\Users\asus\docker_data:/data alpine:latest sh
🔍 What Happened?
Since alpine:latest was not found locally, Docker pulled it from the official repository.
A new container named alpine_with_bind_mount was created.
The -v flag mounted the local directory C:\Users\asus\docker_data to /data inside the container.
The container started a shell (sh) in detached mode.
📄 Step 2: Creating a File Inside the Bind Mount
Inside the container, create a file:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it alpine_with_bind_mount sh -c "echo 'Hello, Aditi!' > /data/testfile.txt"
🔍 What Happened?
The command executed a shell inside the running container.
It created a file testfile.txt inside /data and wrote "Hello, Aditi!" into it.
Since /data is a bind-mounted directory, the file was actually stored in C:\Users\asus\docker_data on the host system.
✅ Step 3: Verifying the File Exists
To check the contents of the file inside the container:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it alpine_with_bind_mount sh -c "cat /data/testfile.txt"
📌 Output:
Copy
Edit
Hello, Aditi!
🎉 This confirms that the file was successfully created and is accessible inside the container.

🗑 Step 4: Removing the First Container
Remove the container:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker rm -f alpine_with_bind_mount
🔍 What Happened?
The container was forcefully stopped and removed.
However, since testfile.txt was inside the bind-mounted directory, it remained on the host system. 🏠
🔄 Step 5: Creating a New Container with the Same Bind Mount
Start a new container:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -dit --name new_alpine -v C:\Users\asus\docker_data:/data alpine sh
🔍 What Happened?
A new container named new_alpine was created.
The same bind-mounted directory (C:\Users\asus\docker_data) was mounted to /data.
🔎 Step 6: Verifying File Persistence
Inside the new container, check if testfile.txt still exists:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it new_alpine sh -c "cat /data/testfile.txt"
📌 Output:
Copy
Edit
Hello, Aditi!
🔥 This confirms that bind mounts persist data even after a container is removed!

🎯 Conclusion
✅ Bind mounts allow data persistence across multiple container instances.
✅ Deleting a container does not remove data stored in the bind-mounted directory.
✅ Any new container with the same mount can access data from previous containers.
✅ Useful for sharing files between containers and persisting data beyond the container’s lifecycle.

📂 Perfect for containerized applications that need persistent storage! 🚀
